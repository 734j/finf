finf
Find in file

Basically grep but worse and with less functionality.

Filename to search in is currently hardcoded to file.txt


TODO:
- Create functionality to find a string within a file (-f) [DONE] 
- Create functionality that prints out the whole line where a match was found.
- Create functionality to specify a file. The program is currently hardcoded to only search inside files called: file.txt
- Fix eventual bugs. 
- Conduct some testing. Write test cases and then execute tests.
